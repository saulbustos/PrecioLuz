PrecioLuz
=========

This is an Android Widget APP for displaying the price of electricity in Spain, segmented in hours. 
As you would know, the electric companies will start billing the home electricity in hours segments, and 
every hour will have a VERY different price, so i decided publish this app for helping saving some money.

The widget will display the current electricity price. The data is obtained for the OMIE web page, and it's
parsed using a PHP gateway, so you will hace to take a took into the PrecioLuz-Webservice project, that is required
for this app to run.
NOTE: Remember to change the url var in DummyActivity.java to point YOUR server and path to listado.php file!

This project is a NetBeans 7 project, written in Java+Android SDK, so if you have all this installed, you're
ready to go



You can find this app compiled in Google Play as well, it's called Tu Consumo de Luz Widget

Have fun
